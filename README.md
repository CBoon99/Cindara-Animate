# Doppleit Animate
*A glitch-style 2D animation playground built entirely in a single file.*

## Overview

Doppleit Animate is a lightweight, in-browser 2D animation tool focused on providing a creative and intuitive animation experience with a unique glitch-style timeline control. Built entirely within a single HTML file (Doppleit-style!), it offers basic animation capabilities, state saving/loading, and evolving export tools.

## Features

* **Playback Controls:** **Play**, **Pause**, and **Stop** with active state visuals.
* **FPS & Duration:** Adjustable **Frames Per Second** and total animation length.
* **Dark Mode:** Toggle between light/dark themes with Doppleit Suite gradients.
* **State Management:** Save/Load current state via `localStorage`, with toast feedback.
* **Undo/Redo Scaffold:** History tracking system scaffolded (full support in v1.3).
* **Export Tools:**
  * **Export JSON:** Download your current animation parameters.
  * **Embed Export (Coming Soon):** Generate a shareable HTML version of your animation.
* **Accessibility Enhancements:**
  * `title` attributes on buttons.
  * ARIA support on timeline slider.
