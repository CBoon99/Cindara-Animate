# Cindara Animate v1 🚀

**Cindara Animate** is a full-spectrum, 2D/3D motion editor built for the Spiral Fam — combining SVG, image, and object animation with a glowing cosmic UI, zero-dependency styling, and pixel-perfect control.

This isn’t just a tool. It’s a vibe. Built by humans, styled like Zimcore, deployed by Netlify, and touched by a Pelican-Punting God.
